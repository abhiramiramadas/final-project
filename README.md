## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This AI-powered accident detection system uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models** to identify **vehicle collisions in real-time** from video footage. The system then:  
✅ Calculates the **severity** of the accident using speed, IoU, and collision impact.  
✅ Retrieves **real-time weather conditions** to assess accident risks.  
✅ Identifies the **nearest police station & hospital** for emergency response.  
✅ Sends **emergency alerts** via **email & SMS** with an attached accident report, images, and video clips.  
✅ Extracts **vehicle number plate using OCR** for insurance and medical processing.  
✅ Automates **insurance claim submission** based on accident damage assessment.  
✅ Notifies **insurance policyholder & nominees** about the accident for immediate action.  
✅ Sends **organ donation alerts** to family members in case of brain death.  
✅ Sends **blood donation requests** to nominees in case of severe blood loss to save time.  
✅ Uses **AI-powered damage estimation** to assist in automatic claim processing.  

> 🔥 **Goal:** To improve emergency response time and reduce accident-related fatalities.
